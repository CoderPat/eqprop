# Equilibrium Propagation (WIP)

This repo contains code for a reimplementation of the paper:

[Generalization of Equilibrium Propagation to Vector Field Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04873)

### Requirements
The code depends on the [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) library. To install all requirements run 

    pip install -r requirements.tx
  
### Running
To run the code, you can launch the `train.py` script in Jupyter notebook with Jupytext installed or run directly in the console
